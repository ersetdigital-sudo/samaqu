# AGENTS.md — running this repo in the Base44 sandbox

Notes that are not obvious from the manifests.

## What this app is

Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack dev) + next-intl + Tailwind 4. All data lives in a
**hosted Supabase project** — there is no local database, ORM, or migration runner in
this setup. `supabase/*.sql` files are applied manually against the hosted project.

`src/lib/supabase.ts` creates the Supabase client at **module scope**, so
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` must be non-empty or the
whole bundle fails to load. `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is needed at request time by
`src/lib/supabase-admin.ts` (admin/order/cron API routes).

## Run it

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.base44.yml up -d --build
docker compose -f docker-compose.base44.yml logs -f web
```

- Only one service (`web`): `node:22`, repo bind-mounted at `/app`, `next dev` on
  `0.0.0.0:3000`, healthcheck probing `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`.
- Dependencies install **inside the container on startup** into the bind-mounted
  `node_modules`, stamped with `node_modules/.base44-lock` (compared against
  `package-lock.json`). Change `package.json`/`package-lock.json` → the next container
  start re-syncs automatically. To force it: `docker compose ... exec web sh -c 'rm node_modules/.base44-lock'` then restart.
- `npm ci` in the repo originally failed (`@swc/helpers` missing from the lockfile);
  `package-lock.json` was regenerated with `npm install` to match `package.json`.
  Re-run `npm install` if the lock ever drifts again.

## Environment / secrets

- `.base44/env.defaults` holds **placeholders** so the app boots before credentials
  exist; it is loaded first in `env_file`.
- Real values come from the platform secret file `/run/base44/app.env`, loaded **last**,
  so they always override the placeholders. Never move a user-supplied key into
  compose `environment:`, and never write secret values into the repo.
- Supabase keys are **required for a meaningful preview**: with placeholders the site
  shell renders (home page falls back to static data) but the catalog (`/katalog`),
  accounts, cart/checkout, orders and admin panel query an unreachable project and come
  up empty. `/katalog` has **no** static fallback — an empty product list is the sign
  the Supabase credentials are missing/wrong.
- Optional integrations that degrade silently when unset: Cloudinary (admin image
  upload), RajaOngkir (shipping cost), J&T Express (tariff/order/track), Meta Pixel.

## Media backup (Cloudinary originals)

The Cloudinary account that hosted most media is no longer accessible (its API key/secret
are unknown), so admin image upload is dead while delivery URLs keep working. Copies of
every reachable original live in the Supabase project's **public** Storage bucket
`media-backup` (`image/…`, `video/…`, plus `_manifest.json` mapping original URL →
bucket path → table). Re-run a backup with the Supabase REST + Storage APIs
(`/rest/v1/<table>` to find URLs, strip the Cloudinary transform segment to get the
original, then POST `/storage/v1/object/media-backup/<path>`); one-off scripts belong in
`/tmp`, never in the repo. ~64 older URLs on the clouds `dgtixuop0` / `dfxc4ceya` return
401 at source (testimonials, category/`katalog_info`/`size_guide` images, old order
items) — unfixable without those accounts; product main images are all intact.

## Sandbox-only overrides

- `next.config.ts` appends `allowedDevOrigins: ['3000-' + BASE44_PUBLIC_HOST_SUFFIX]`
  **only when `BASE44_PREVIEW_MODE === '1'`**, because the preview proxies the dev
  server through a different origin and Next otherwise rejects cross-origin dev
  asset/HMR requests (403). Unset/none → identical config to upstream.
  Verify: a `GET` on a `/_next/static/chunks/...` URL with
  `Origin: https://3000-$BASE44_PUBLIC_HOST_SUFFIX` must return 200.

## Rich text messages (i18n)

next-intl 4 treats `<tag>` inside a message as ICU rich text. Reading such a message with
plain `t()` throws and falls back to the raw key (logged as `FORMATTING_ERROR` /
`INVALID_MESSAGE`), which is how the home, about and Sama Quran pages ended up rendering
key names. Rules that now hold:

- HTML in a message must use **closed** ICU tags — `<br></br>`, `<span>…</span>`. A
  self-closing `<br/>` is passed through as literal text, and tag **attributes** are
  rejected outright (`INVALID_TAG`), so styling is re-applied by the handler.
- Read such a message with `t.markup(key, { tag: (chunks) => "<tag>…</tag>" })`; it returns a
  string for `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Sites: `CaraPemesanan` (`subtitleLead` + `subtitle`),
  `SamaQuran` (`perjalananTitle`, `values.*`), both `tentang-kami` pages (`storyP1`).
- `useSafeTranslations`' no-provider fallback mirrors `markup`/`rich`/`raw`, so callers keep
  working (and type-checking) when `NextIntlClientProvider` isn't mounted.

## Verify

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -L http://localhost:3000/     # expect 200 (redirects to /id)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://localhost:3000/id/katalog # expect 200, and product cards in the browser
# If a route that just worked starts returning 404 right after the container is
# recreated, the bind-mounted .next Turbopack cache has gone stale — `docker compose
# -f docker-compose.base44.yml restart web` restores it (no code change needed).
docker compose -f docker-compose.base44.yml ps                          # web must be (healthy)
```
